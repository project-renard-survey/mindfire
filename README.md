## What is MindFire?
MindFire is an eBook reader which utilizes RSVP to help the user read at incredible speeds. MindFire is the evolution on the work started with GnomeRSVP. Using a new engine created with Mono/.NET, it will bring the excellent Linux speed reading tool to Windows, OS X, and more! It will also boast new features, and functionality crafted for ease of use!

## What is Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP)?
Rapid Serial Visual Presentation is the process of blasting words onto the screen. In this dynamic representation of text, each word is flashed on the screen one at a time in succession. The reader is less inclined to “subvocalize” the text, rather the reader interprets whole words as meaningful written symbols. Automatic re-reading of adjacent previous text is therefore rendered impossible. This results in much higher reading speeds than are possible with conventional techniques.

## Current Features
MindFire at this time provides the following features:

* Font Selection
* Color Selection
* Multilingual support (UTF-8)
* Variable speed from 120 to 6000 words per minute

## Planned Features
As development increases expect to see the following:

* Bookmarks / Library
* Browser integration
* HTML, and PDF file support
* PDA version
* Read from buffer
* Session Support
* URI support

## Requirements:
Mono or .NET runtime
